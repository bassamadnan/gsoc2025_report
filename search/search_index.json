This project adds extension support to pgexporter, enabling automatic detection, version handling, and metric collection from popular PostgreSQL extensions.

Engaging with syscalls for the first time outside an academic project, I got to learn much more about how shared memory space works, transferring data via HTTP (by building my own HTTP suite!) and where exactly is encryption used in the network. Apart from that, PostgreSQL wire protocol was a very fun read. Abit of a nightmare to deal with was GitHub Actions, I still remember the time we had one failing test case only in FreeBSD systems while every other system seemed just okay.</p> <p>Apart from that, one major thing which I will always hold on to from this project is engaging in constant discussions, reaching out to help and make good quality PRs so as to not waste the mentors time. To me, the most important thing i've learned out of this project is communication.</p>"},{"location":"#future-work","title":"Future Work","text":"<ul> <li>More Extensions: pg_partman, pg_qualstats, hstore metrics</li> <li>Monitoring Solutions: Alternative to Grafana more fine tuned for pgexporter use cases.</li> </ul>"},{"location":"#acknowledgements","title":"Acknowledgements","text":"<p>Huge thanks to my mentors Jesper Pedersen and Saurav Pal for their guidance, code reviews, and patience throughout this journey.
